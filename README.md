## Salutations! I'm Wolf, a brooklynite techie majoring in CS at [Case Western](https://case.edu/). I'm interested in fullstack and webdev, and love working with tooling of all kinds. I'm a [Bard HS Early College](https://bhsec.bard.edu/queens/) alum, and I just finished a second batch at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/), a self-driven programming retreat, delving deep into `Nix`, and working on an Android-in-the-browser project.

### Feel free to contact me at [wolf@404wolf.com](mailto:wolf@404wolf.com), signal/whatsapp/text me at (212)767-WOLF *(WOLF=9653), or discord me at @Wolf#1452.
