## Salutations! I'm Wolf, a brooklynite techie who'll start as a CS major at [Case Western](https://case.edu/) next fall. I'm interested in fullstack, but also in further exploring additional eclectic areas of CS. I recently graduated from [Bard HS Early College](https://bhsec.bard.edu/queens/), and currently I'm spending the summer at [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/), a self-driven programming retreat.

### Feel free to contact me at reimagine@msn.com, or discord me at @Wolf#1452, or make an [appointment to meet me](https://calendar.app.google/azLnG8iFdPStaWaFA)!
