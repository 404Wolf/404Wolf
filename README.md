##Salutations! I'm Wolf, a brooklynite techie who'll start as a CS major at Case Western next fall. I'm interested in fullstack, but also in further exploring additional eclectic areas of CS. I recently graduated from Bard HS Early College, and currently I'm spending the summer at Recurse Center, a self-driven programming retreat.

### Feel free to contact me at reimagine@msn.com, or discord me at @Wolf#1452
